                  Rapid Startup of Congestion Control
                  draft-kazuho-ccwg-rapid-start-latest

Abstract

   This document defines Rapid Start, a congestion-control startup
   algorithm that grows the window by 3× per RTT until queue buildup is
   observed, so a sender can reach the path BDP faster than with classic
   2× slow start.  When congestion is observed, Rapid Start immediately
   scales the window relative to the bytes passed through the bottleneck
   and hands over to normal recovery and congestion avoidance.

1.  Introduction

   New transport connections do not know the available bandwidth or the
   bandwidth–delay product (BDP) of the path, so TCP and QUIC start from
   an initial window and use an exponential startup (“slow start”) to
   probe for the bottleneck.  Classic slow start doubles the congestion
   window once per RTT; this is safe but can take several RTTs to reach
   the path BDP on high-RTT or high-BDP paths.  This is a poor fit for
   short-lived connections such as HTTP, where many connections complete
   while still in the startup phase.

   Rapid Start keeps this IW-based probing model but increases the
   congestion window by 3× per RTT while an RTT-sized observation window
   shows no queueing, so that the sender reaches the path BDP in fewer
   RTTs than with 2× slow start.  Once queue buildup is observed in that
   window, Rapid Start stops using 3× growth and reverts to 2× growth.
   If actual congestion is signaled (for example by packet loss or ECN),
   Rapid Start does not simply apply a fixed multiplicative decrease;
   instead it scales the window based on the amount of data that has
   passed the bottleneck in that round and then hands control over to
   normal recovery and congestion avoidance.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Algorithm

   This section describes the algorithm used by Rapid Start.

3.1.  Rapid Start Phase

   When the path appears not to be building a queue, the sender uses a
   more aggressive startup increase than classic slow start.

   Whether the path is "not building a queue" is determined by comparing
   the floor RTT of the most recent round-trip with the connection's
   minimum RTT.

   Let:

   *  min_rtt be the minimum RTT observed for the connection so far; and

   *  rtt_floor be the minimum RTT sample observed during the last
      round-trip (i.e., within the most recent interval of length
      min_rtt).

   If rtt_floor is no greater than min(min_rtt + 4ms, min_rtt * 1.10),
   the sender increases the congestion window (cwnd) by 2 bytes for
   every byte that is newly acknowledged, which results in a 3× growth
   of cwnd per round-trip time.

   If rtt_floor is greater than the threshold, the sender SHOULD
   increase the congestion window as classic slow start does; i.e., by 1
   byte for every byte that is newly acknowledged, which results in a 2×
   growth of cwnd per round-trip time.

   The additive term (+4 ms) and the multiplicative term (×1.10) are
   RECOMMENDED defaults that provide tolerance for typical jitter while
   keeping Rapid Start out of the range where early queueing detection
   algorithms such as HyStart++ are known to trigger.  Therefore,
   HyStart++ can be used in conjunction with Rapid Start.

3.2.  Pacing Requirement

   Rapid Start uses a more aggressive growth factor than classic slow
   start.  When such growth is used, sending the initial congestion
   window as a short burst can make the sender observe a bottleneck
   overflow earlier than it would under evenly paced transmission.  To
   ensure that Rapid Start observes the path's queueing behavior rather
   than sender-side burstiness, a sender that fully fills the
   connection's congestion window for the first time MUST use the pacing
   described in Careful Resume ([CAREFUL-RESUME]).

   For connections that have no prior knowledge of the path (i.e., no
   previously saved CC parameters applicable to the 4-tuple), the sender
   SHOULD limit the initial jump window (jump_cwnd) to at most 2 * IW.
   With this bound, the required pacing rate (pacing_rate = jump_cwnd /
   min_rtt) does not exceed the pacing rate that would be used by
   classic slow start with pacing, so Rapid Start does not create a
   larger burst than existing paced startup.
